##Project Description
Imaginary Scenario:
The CEO of AdventureWorks has hired me as an independent contractor to perform a detailed analysis in search of any equal pay regulation violations so that the company might rectify them before they become a legal problem.

Imaginary Bonus Goal:
In the event of a satisfactory outome of the initial scenario, the client is willing to pay a large one-time development fee if the provided code can be easily run by their internal team every year without the need for extensive training of staff (code would need to be able to handle new data and still maintain precision of output validity; would also benefit heavily from end-user requiring as little knowledge as possible).

###Motivation
Most of my work has been in private repositories dealing with potentially sensitive materials and/or proprietary information. Even in instances where the work is encoded and removed from identification or trade-secrets, I consider it a violation of trust to publicly share the work without express written permission from the client organizations.

Furthermore, my involvement in the field of research psychology is now far enough in my past that I can not rely on those projects to accurately display my skill set to cooperators and potential employers.

This particular project was devised as a way for me to show off some data manipulation as well as offering a glimpse into my analysis and reporting capabilities.

The vast majority of this project is being completed in my spare time between real projects.

###Why This Project?


###What Problem Does It Solve?

###What Did I Learn?


###What Technologies I Used & Why?
* MS SQL Server (no point & click allowed)
* MS SQL Server Management Studio 18

SQL Server was chosen for its combination of breadth of use in the industry and that the developer version for projects like this is free to use.
